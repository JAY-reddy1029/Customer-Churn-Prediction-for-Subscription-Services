# Customer-Churn-Prediction-for-Subscription-Services
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in subscription-based services using machine learning techniques. Churn refers to the likelihood of a customer discontinuing a subscription, which is a critical metric for businesses aiming to improve customer retention and revenue growth.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographics, subscription details, and usage patterns.

Includes features such as tenure, payment method, service usage, and customer support interactions.

The dataset is preprocessed for handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.

## 🚀 Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Implementation of multiple Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Model evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

Insights into the most important factors contributing to customer churn.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)

Scikit-learn, XGBoost (Machine Learning)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Jupyter Notebook / Spyder (Development Environment)
